# C++ Final Project Linear Search Array

## Project specifications:

A program that would only accept number input from user. It would take input number and compare to "account numbers" currently stored
in the program. Indicate to the user whether or not a match was found.


## My thoughts

This was by far my most challanging program. I was still struggling with understanding objects and classes. It would require traps
to catch incorrect input. I decided to give the output some color and learned how to even make a menu type header to welcome
the user.
